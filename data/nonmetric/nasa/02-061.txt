NASA ADMNISTRATOR NAMES TASK FORCE TO REVIEW
BIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS

     NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe has selected an 
independent task force to provide recommendations regarding 
the research priorities of the agency's Office of 
Biological and Physical Research (OBPR).

Designated the Research Maximization and Prioritization 
Task Force, REMAP will serve as a follow on to the 
International Space Station Management and Cost Evaluation 
(IMCE) Task Force, which last year evaluated the budget and 
management challenges facing the International Space 
Station program.

REMAP is chartered to perform an independent review and 
assessment of research productivity and priorities for the 
entire scientific, technological and commercial portfolio 
of OBPR and to provide recommendations on how best to 
achieve its research goals within the President's budget 
request.

Chaired by Dr. Rae Silver, an original member of the IMCE 
panel and professor of Natural and Physical Sciences at 
Columbia University, the REMAP task force will provide 
important guidance on how to maximize the scientific 
returns on many NASA programs, including the space station. 

"The space station project should be driven by specific 
research objectives and will be as integral a part of 
NASA's future as any of our research centers here on 
Earth," Administrator O'Keefe said. "When people look back 
and ask what was important about the International Space 
Station, it will be the scientific achievements that will 
be remembered."

Dr. David Shirley, Director Emeritus of the Lawrence 
Berkeley National Laboratory at the University of 
California, will serve as REMAP Vice Chair. He was a 
protege of Dr. Glenn Theodore Seaborg, who worked on the 
Manhattan Project and was awarded the Nobel Prize in 
Chemistry in 1951.

Along with Dr. Silver, fellow IMCE task force members Dr. 
Richard Roberts, 1993 Nobel Laureate and Research Director 
of New England Biolabs in Massachusetts and Dr. Anthony 
Acrivos, Einstein Professor of Science and Engineering, 
City University of New York will be among the distinguished 
members that make up the REMAP Task Force.

"The charter of this task force is important and will 
literally help set the bar for NASA's future science and 
research efforts on the International Space Station," said 
Mary Kicza, newly appointed Associate Administrator of 
OBPR. "Its contributions will have a profound impact and 
will help the agency and our international partners realize 
the full potential of this unique space laboratory." 

The REMAP Task Force will convene its first session in 
April. By June, the panel is expected to provide its report 
to the NASA Advisory Council, which will review the 
findings and formally present its recommendations to 
Administrator O'Keefe.
